# 🧱 Container Ecosystem Architecture

This diagram represents the architecture of a modern container ecosystem, showing how containerized applications are managed from execution to orchestration.

---

## 🔧 Runtime (Bottom Layer)
The **Runtime** is the low-level component responsible for actually running containers.

- Executes containers on the operating system.
- Manages isolation, namespaces, and cgroups.

**Examples:**
- `runc`
- `containerd`

---

## ⚙️ Engine (Middle Layer)
The **Engine** is responsible for building, managing, and running containers. It interacts with the runtime and provides an API/CLI to the user.

**Key Functions:**
- Build Docker images
- Manage containers
- Handle networking and volumes

**Example:**
- Docker Engine

---

## 📡 Orchestrator (Top Layer)
The **Orchestrator** manages a cluster of containers and automates their deployment, scaling, and operations.

**Features:**
- Auto-scaling
- Load balancing
- Self-healing
- Rolling updates

**Examples:**
- Kubernetes
- Docker Swarm

---

## 📌 Summary

- The **Runtime** runs containers.
- The **Engine** manages them.
- The **Orchestrator** scales and coordinates them.

This layered model provides a clear separation of responsibilities, helping to build scalable and maintainable container-based infrastructure.
