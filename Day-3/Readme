# 3️⃣ Day 3 - April 16, 2025

## 🚀 Topics Covered
- AWS IAM,Roles,permissions,AWS Organizations, Assume Roles.
- 

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Discovered how user groups streamline permissions by attaching policies at a group level.
- Configured specific permissions for individual users, understanding the principle of least privilege.
- Created organizational units to structure AWS resources, even nesting child units for finer-grained management.
- Explored the power of 'Assume Role' to grant temporary, specific access to a user, enhancing security posture.

### 🖥️  Practiced:
- Hands-on experience creating a demo user group and user (avoiding the root user - good practice!), then attaching policies and roles to manage access.
- Implemented OU structure with a parent and child unit for better organization.
- Practiced granting a user full S3 access temporarily via an assumed role, a powerful technique for secure delegation.
