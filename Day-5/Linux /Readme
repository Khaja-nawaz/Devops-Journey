# 5️⃣ Day 5Linux Command Basics Learned Today (April 18, 2025)

This README summarizes the fundamental Linux commands I focused on learning today.

## Core Commands Explored:

* **`pwd` (Print Working Directory):**
    * **Purpose:** Displays the full path of the current directory you are in.
    * **Example:**
        ```bash
        pwd
        ```
        * **Output:** `/home/your_username/current_folder`

* **`mkdir` (Make Directory):**
    * **Purpose:** Creates new directories.
    * **Examples:**
        ```bash
        mkdir new_directory
        mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3
        mkdir -p path/to/nested/directory
        ```
        * `-p`: Creates parent directories if they don't exist.

* **`rm` (Remove):**
    * **Purpose:** Deletes files and directories. **Use with caution!**
    * **Examples:**
        ```bash
        rm my_file.txt
        rmdir empty_folder
        rm -r directory_to_delete
        rm -rf problematic_folder # Use with extreme care!
        ```
        * `-r`: Recursively removes a directory and its contents.
        * `-f`: Forces removal, suppressing warnings.
        * `rmdir`: Removes an empty directory.

* **`cp` (Copy):**
    * **Purpose:** Creates copies of files and directories.
    * **Examples:**
        ```bash
        cp original.txt copy.txt
        cp file.txt another_directory/
        cp -r source_directory destination_directory/
        ```
        * `-r`: Recursively copies a directory and its contents.

* **`mv` (Move):**
    * **Purpose:** Moves or renames files and directories.
    * **Examples (Renaming):**
        ```bash
        mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
        mv old_folder new_folder
        ```
    * **Examples (Moving):**
        ```bash
        mv file.txt target_directory/
        mv directory_to_move another_location/
        ```

##What I learned Today:

Today's learning reinforced the importance of understanding the current working directory and using paths correctly when manipulating files and directories. Special attention was paid to the power and potential dangers of the `rm` command, especially with the `-r` and `-f` flags.

These commands are fundamental for navigating and managing files within a Linux environment.
