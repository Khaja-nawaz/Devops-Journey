## üì¶ Prerequisites

- AWS account with appropriate S3 permissions (`s3:CreateBucket`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`)
- AWS CLI configured via `aws configure`
- Python environment with `boto3` installed:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create an S3 Bucket

```
import boto3

s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

response = s3_client.create_bucket(
    Bucket='your-unique-bucket-name-123',
    CreateBucketConfiguration={'LocationConstraint': 'ap-south-1'}
)

print("Bucket created:", response)
```
