# ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions ‚Äì Basic Theory

This repository documents my initial understanding and theory-based learning of **GitHub Actions**, a CI/CD tool built into GitHub for automating software workflows.

## üöÄ What is GitHub Actions?

**GitHub Actions** is a **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)** platform that allows you to automate workflows directly from your GitHub repository.

With Actions, you can:
- Build, test, and deploy your code automatically
- Trigger jobs on events like push, pull request, or schedule
- Run workflows in containers or virtual machines

| Concept           | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Workflow**      | A YAML file that defines the automation process                             |
| **Event**         | Triggers a workflow, e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, or `schedule`            |
| **Job**           | A set of steps run on the same runner                                       |
| **Step**          | An individual task within a job (e.g., run a command, use an action)        |
| **Runner**        | A server that runs your workflows (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted)            |
| **Actions**       | Reusable units of work written by GitHub or the community                   |
