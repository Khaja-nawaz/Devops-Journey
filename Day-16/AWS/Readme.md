# Today's AWS Learning:

I successfully completed the following AWS activities today:

* **Launch a web server with termination protection enabled:** I launched an EC2 instance and configured it to host a web server. I also enabled termination protection to prevent accidental deletion.
* **Monitor Your EC2 instance:** I set up monitoring for my EC2 instance, likely using CloudWatch, to track key metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic.
* **Modify the security group that your web server is using to allow HTTP access:** I modified the security group associated with my EC2 instance to allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP), enabling access to the web server from the internet.
* **Resize your Amazon EC2 instance to scale:** I resized my EC2 instance, which means I changed the instance type to either scale up (increase resources) or scale down (decrease resources) based on the needs of my web server.
* **Test termination protection:** I tested the termination protection I enabled earlier to confirm that the EC2 instance cannot be accidentally terminated.
* **Terminate your EC2 instance:** I terminated the EC2 instance.

##   Summary

Today's focus was on working with EC2 instances, including launching, configuring, monitoring, scaling, securing, and managing their lifecycle.

##   Exercises


1.  **How to resize the EC2 instance without stopping it:**

2.  **How to create a Golden Image (AMI):**
  
3.  **How to copy or move the instance region to another / between AZ:**
