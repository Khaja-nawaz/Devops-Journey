# 🧪 DevOps Pipeline Stages
## This document outlines the typical stages involved in the software development and release pipeline—from writing code to deploying in production.

1. 🧠 Source
- What it is:
    - The initial stage where code is written and managed.

- Tools involved:

    - Git/GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket (Version Control)

- Purpose:

    - Code collaboration, versioning, and backup.

    - Branching strategies (feature, develop, main).


2. 🏗️ Build
- What it is:
    - Converts source code into executable format (binaries, packages, etc.).

- Tools involved:

    - Jenkins, Maven, Gradle, GitHub Actions

- Purpose:

    - Compile code, resolve dependencies.

    - Package application artifacts for the next stages.

3. 🧪 Test Environment
- What it is:
    - A dedicated setup to run automated tests on the build.

- Tools involved:

    - Selenium, JUnit, PyTest, Postman (API Tests)

- Purpose:

    - Catch bugs early.

    - Validate logic, security, and performance.
 
4. 🧪🖥️ Pre-Production Environment (Staging / 1-box)

- Also called:
        - 1-box (a single server mock of production)
        
- Purpose:

    - Mirror of the production setup for final validations.

    - Manual QA testing or UAT (User Acceptance Testing).

- Looks like:
    - Production in configuration, but isolated.
 

5. 🚀 Production Environment (Actual)
- What it is:
    - The real, user-facing environment.

- Purpose:

    - Serve live users.

    - Needs high availability, reliability, and monitoring.

- Tools involved:

    - AWS, GCP, Azure (Infra)

    - Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, CloudWatch (Monitoring)
 
✅ By following this staged approach, we can  ensure code quality, minimize risks, and deliver reliable software faster.
