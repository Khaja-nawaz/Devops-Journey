## 🔧 Git Basics

Today, I practiced essential Git commands to understand version control workflows:

### 🛠️ Commands Practiced

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git add`: Stage changes for the next commit.
- `git status`: Display the state of the working directory and staging area.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Record staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git log`: View the commit history.
- `rm -rf .git`: Remove the Git repository (use with caution).:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

### 📂 Understanding the Staging Area

In Git, the staging area, also known as the index or cache, acts as an intermediary between your working directory and the repository. It's where you prepare the changes you want to include in your next commit.
