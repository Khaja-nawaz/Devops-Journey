# üåç Terraform - Providers, Multiple Regions & Variables

This README documents today's learnings in Terraform, including how providers work, setting up multiple providers for multi-region deployments, and working with variables using `.tfvars` files.

---

## üß© 1. What are Providers?

Providers are plugins in Terraform that allow interaction with various APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.). They define the cloud or platform Terraform will manage.

### Example:
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```
# üåê 2. Multiple Providers (Multi-Region Infrastructure)

---

To deploy infrastructure in multiple regions, we can define multiple provider blocks using aliases.
```hcl 
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_east"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_west"
  region = "us-west-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "east_server" {
  provider      = aws.us_east
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_instance" "west_server" {
  provider      = aws.us_west
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

# üéõÔ∏è 3. Variables in Terraform

---
Terraform allows the use of input variables to make configurations flexible and reusable.
```hcl
# variables.tf
variable "region" {
  description = "AWS Region"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Type of EC2 instance"
  type        = string
}
```

# üóÇÔ∏è 4. Using .tfvars File

---

To separate config values from code, you can store values in .tfvars.
```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
instance_type = "t2.micro"
```

To Apply the configuration with:
```hcl
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

# 5 Sample Code with Variables and Providers 

```hcl
# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}

```

```hcl
# variables.tf
variable "region" {
  description = "AWS Region"
  type        = string
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Type of EC2 instance"
  type        = string
}
```
