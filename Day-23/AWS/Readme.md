# 📘 Learning Log – AWS CloudWatch, 

This repository documents my recent learning progress in:

- **AWS CloudWatch** 

## ☁️ AWS CloudWatch (Theory Only)

I explored the official AWS documentation to understand the foundational concepts of **Amazon CloudWatch**, a monitoring and observability service for AWS resources and applications.

### 📚 Topics Covered

- **Namespaces**: Logical containers for CloudWatch metrics, isolating metrics from different applications.
- **Metrics**: Time-ordered data points representing the performance of your systems.
- **Dimensions**: Name-value pairs that uniquely identify a metric.
- **Resolution**: The granularity of metric data (Standard: 1-minute, High-resolution: up to 1-second).
- **Statistics**: Aggregated metric data (Average, Sum, Minimum, Maximum, SampleCount).
- **Percentiles**: Statistical values indicating the relative standing of a value within a dataset (e.g., p95).
- **Alarms**: Notifications triggered based on metric thresholds.

> 📌 *Note: This was a theoretical study; no hands-on practice was performed.*
