## 🔁 DevOps Lifecycle: 7 Key Stages

DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that integrates **development** and **operations** to deliver software faster and more reliably.

### 🔹 1. **Plan**
- Define requirements and tasks.

  
### 🔹 2. **Develop**
- Code is written and version-controlled.

### 🔹 3. **Build**
- Code is compiled or packaged.

### 🔹 4. **Test**
- Automated and manual testing to ensure quality.

### 🔹 5. **Release**
- Code is prepared for deployment.
- Involves artifact storage, versioning, tagging.

### 🔹 6. **Deploy**
- Application is released to staging or production.

### 🔹 7. **Operate & Monitor**
- Applications are monitored for performance, errors, usage.

## 🐳 Docker Basics

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside **lightweight containers**.

### 🔸 What I Learned

- **Docker simplifies app deployment** by packaging code with dependencies.
- Containers run consistently across environments (dev, test, prod).
- Docker uses **images** to create containers.
- Dockerfile is a script that defines how to build an image.

### 🔸 Key Docker Concepts

| Concept        | Description                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Image          | Blueprint to create containers                 |
| Container      | Running instance of a Docker image             |
| Dockerfile     | Script to build custom images                  |
| `docker run`   | Runs a container                               |
| `docker ps`    | Lists running containers                       |
| `docker build` | Builds an image from a Dockerfile              |
| `docker pull`  | Downloads image from Docker Hub                |
| `docker exec`  | Runs commands inside a running container       |
| `docker stop` / `rm` | Stops or removes containers              |
