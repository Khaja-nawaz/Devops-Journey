# 🧠 Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT) – Networking Basics Learning Log

This README documents my hands-on learning experience using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, focusing on foundational networking components such as **hubs**, **switches**, and **routers**.

---

## 📌 Tools Used

- ✅ **Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT)**
- 🖥️ Simulation-based network design and troubleshooting

---

## 🌐 Topics Covered

### 1. 🧩 Hubs
- Basic networking device
- Operates at **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)** of the OSI model
- Broadcasts data to all connected devices (no intelligence)
- Learned how it can cause **network collisions**

### 2. 🧠 Switches
- Operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**
- Forwards data intelligently using **MAC addresses**
- Reduces unnecessary traffic
- Supports full-duplex communication
- Learned how switches improve **network performance** over hubs

### 3. 🌍 Routers
- Operates at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**
- Connects **different networks** together
- Makes routing decisions based on **IP addresses**
- Helps in segmenting LANs and connecting to the internet
- Explored static vs dynamic routing concepts (at a basic level)

---

## 🔧 Hands-On Activities

- Created a basic LAN using **PCs, Hubs, and Switches**
- Configured basic IP addressing between devices
- Connected and tested **inter-network communication** using routers
- Simulated packet flows to observe how devices communicate

---

## 📚 What I Gained

- Fundamental understanding of how data flows within and between networks
- Visualized the difference between broadcasting (hub) and switching (switch)
- Understood routing concepts in real-world topologies
