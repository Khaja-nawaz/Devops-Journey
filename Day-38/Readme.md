# 🐳 Switched from Docker Desktop to Rancher Desktop
## I’ve officially switched from Docker Desktop to Rancher Desktop as part of my container development workflow.

## 💡 Why the Switch?

### Feature	Docker Desktop	Rancher Desktop

| Feature                  | Docker Desktop              | Rancher Desktop              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ✅ GUI for container mgmt | Yes                         | Yes                         |
| 💰 Licensing             | Commercial license required | Free and open-source         |
| 🐧 Native Linux support  | No (on Windows/Mac)         | Yes (WSL2 / macOS / Linux)   |
| 🧰 Kubernetes built-in   | Limited in free version     | Built-in with full control   |
| 🔄 Container runtime     | Uses Docker Engine          | Uses containerd (by default) |

## 🧰 What is Rancher Desktop?
- Rancher Desktop is an open-source container management platform that provides:

- Container runtimes: containerd or dockerd

- Kubernetes integration: Built-in lightweight K8s clusters

- CLI compatibility: Uses nerdctl (Docker-compatible)

- Filesystem isolation: Via WSL2 or native hypervisors

## ✅ Benefits I Noticed
- Fully open-source and lightweight

- Seamless Kubernetes support for learning and testing

- Avoids Docker Desktop’s licensing restrictions

- Actively maintained by the Rancher/SUSE community
